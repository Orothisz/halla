These Terms of Service (“Terms”) constitute a binding legal agreement between you (the “User,” “Delegate,” “Registrant”) and the Organising Committee (“OC”) of Noir Model United Nations (“Noir MUN”), including its Executive Board (“EB”), with headquarters in Faridabad, Haryana, India. By registering, making payment, attending, participating, signing up, or otherwise accessing any aspect of Noir MUN, you irrevocably accept and agree to all provisions herein, and voluntarily waive any expectation of signature, explanation, or further acknowledgment thereof. These Terms are governed by the Indian Contract Act, 1872, the Information Technology Act, 2000 (including section 10A), and are subject exclusively to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Faridabad, Haryana, India.

27. NO ORAL MODIFICATIONS

28. INTERPRETIVE PROVISIONS & EXTENDED CLAUSES
Delegates are hereby further bound by all provisions below:
OC need not explain the rationale behind any decision, scoring, award, disqualification, or removal—no entitlement exists.
Prior actions by OC/EB in previous editions do not establish precedent; OC retains full discretion at all times.
Unlimited right to blacklist, remove, or prevent reentry without notice, explanation, or refund.
Technical failures, venue disruptions, missing items, weather, internet issues, and AV problems do not warrant compensation, substitution, rescheduling, or fee adjustment.
Delegates waive all claims for direct, indirect, consequential, incidental, punitive, legal or emotional damages arising from participation or decisions made by OC/EB unless caused by OC's gross negligence.
OC maintains complete opacity regarding budgets, fee allocations, vendor contracts, sponsorship revenue — no financial breakdown required.
Delegates certify cognitive maturity, understanding of complexity, and waive all claims of misunderstanding, ignorance, or failure to read.
No right to access internal documents, logs, presentations, score sheets, correspondence, or deliberations; these remain confidential and inaccessible.
Delegates cannot organize or promote rival events within ±30 days of Noir MUN without OC's written permission.
OC reserves the right to screen, background-check, verify identity, credentials; any inauthenticity will lead to disqualification and blacklisting.
OC may revoke decisions, shift venues, reposition sessions, or cancel without refund; no recourse permitted.
Silence or lack of response shall be deemed consent to all communications and changes.
Participants waive psychological, emotional, or mental health claims arising from debate stress, committee pressure, or public speaking discomfort.
OC may retain delegate records, IP logs, UPI metadata, email metadata, and such for compliance or legal archival without time-based deletion or consent.
Delegates consent to algorithmic scoring, black-box systems, or confirmative decision frameworks; no transparency or recourse required.
OC may limit seat availability arbitrarily to balance demographics or preserve exclusivity; this is not deceptive.
The delegate unconditionally agrees that any and all disputes, claims, or controversies arising from participation in Noir MUN—including but not limited to decisions, awards, disqualifications, refunds, data handling, or event logistics—shall be resolved exclusively through internal administrative procedures defined by the Noir MUN Organising Committee. The delegate expressly and irrevocably waives any right to initiate or participate in any form of legal proceedings—including suits, writs, or injunctive claims—before any court or tribunal, except where such limitation is expressly prohibited by law. In the event that legal recourse is pursued despite this waiver, the delegate agrees that such proceedings shall only be initiated in the courts of Faridabad, Haryana, and only after the delegate has demonstrably exhausted all internal redressal options. The delegate further waives any entitlement to collective, class, or representative actions, and agrees that any claim shall be raised solely on an individual basis. This clause shall survive completion, cancellation, disqualification, or withdrawal from the event, and shall apply retroactively to all previous editions of Noir MUN to the extent permitted by law.
OC has sole power of interpretation; ambiguous terms will always be interpreted in favour of OC.
Internal records (timestamps, logs, financial registrations, IP address data) hold precedence over any screenshots, conversations, or testimonies by Delegates.
Delegates may not publicly disclose, reproduce, or use Event communications, announcements, or conflicts for any purpose, unless they first submit grievances via email and allow 48-hour processing.
Delegates forfeit rights to ask for detailed deliberation records, internal emails, committee chat logs, notification history.
OC is not liable for personal or property losses; unattended minors are responsibility of guardians only.
Delegates release any right to have deliverables itemized, rationalized, or explained.
This section and the Terms may be updated retroactively, and Delegates consent to future changes without need for resignation or repayment.

29. SEVERABILITY
If any clause herein is determined invalid or unenforceable, such determination shall not impair any other clause. OC-preferred interpretations shall survive.

30. GOVERNING LANGUAGE
Only the English version of these Terms is legally binding.
